The Stepper Boss, Model SB_T41_4on_2ext, is a carrier board with all SMD parts and headers soldered and 
ready to receive the modules (modules not provided) your project requires
to give functions for applications such as animatronic props, kinetic sculpture, museum dioramas,
talking and moving mannequins and any project which can use the following functions.

- Carries a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. (not included)
- Available at https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41_pins.html and at Digikey.com.
- Carries up to four (4) onboard  DRV8825 Stepper Motor Drivers (not included),
  for small steppers such as N17 and N11. (not included)
- Provides for signal outputs to up to two (2) external stepper drivers
  which can be used for steppers (not included) as large as needed. 
- Provides input for an audience sensing PIR Motion Sensor. (not included)
- Carries a DFPayer Mini stereo player for wmv or mp3 files. (not included)
- Provides for 1-Wire interface for using multiple DS18B20 digital temperature sensors. (not included)
- Provides for I2C interface used for the LCD display on the Model USER-IO_Stereo. (not included)
  With extension I2C signals for other I2C devices your project may require.
  
  Example sketches to test all functions are provided at this GitHub.
